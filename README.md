Iâ€™ve assumed:
1. Each applicant has a unique phone number.
2. There will always be 4 batches in a month at their respective times as provided in the problem statement.
3. One person can enroll in only one slot in a month.
4. The application accepts applications for the current month only.


### Explanation for Database Design 
    @OneToMany Relationship between Year and Month since each year has 12 months.
    @OneToMany Relationship between Month and Batch since each month has 4 batches.
    @OneToMany Relationship between Batch and User since each Batch has multiple customers/users.

    Primary Key for Year is the year itself.
    Primary Key for all other entities is the unique @GeneratedValue Id.
